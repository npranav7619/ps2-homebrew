
ExecFTPs Information by Slicstik 2004


- ExecFTPs is a standalone FTP-server running on PS2.

- It supports access to memorycard and harddrive (not HDAdvance partitions .. yet).

- This FTP-server is compatible with many FTP-clients but its recommended to
use FlashFXP.

- ExecFTPs reads information from CONFIG.DAT (located in same folder as ExecFTPs.ELF or 
mc0:/BOOT/EXECFTPS/
mc0:/EXECFTPS/
mc0:/SYS-CONF/
mc0:/SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT)
This file contains net information.  (mode-setting is now removed..always tries with MC+HD)

CONFIG.DAT requires one line looking like this:

192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1

(First param is PS2-ip, second is netmask, third is Gateway IP.)


- ExecFTPs is currently tested working with following start-methods:
	
	+Burn disc and boot.
		(Dont forget to update CONFIG.DAT with your settings and create the disc
		using cdgenps2.exe and add a large dummy-file to image (like an mp3 or something)
		(Add all files in rar to disc )).

	+Execute from MC using MC-handling prog like DMS Explorer or PS2menu.
 	(Dont forget to update CONFIG.DAT with your settings and transfer EXECFTPS.ELF
	and CONFIG.DAT to MC-folder)
	
	+It also works to run from HD using ps2menu-k or DMS3 HDDExplorer. (didnt try any other app so far..)

	+Works to use ps2link(booted from disc or mc) and inlink


- When ExecFTPs is ready to accept calls from FTP-client the PS2-screen output is
'____FTP Server initialized on port 21...!'.


Transfer speed

- For a 500 kb file the transfer speed should be approx:
MC: up 110 KBps / down 25 KBps 
HD: up 550 KBps / down 25 KBps 




Regarding FTP-client:


- Path to access memorycard in slot 1 is /mc/0/ , and /mc/1/ for memcard in slot 2.

- Path to hdd root is /hdd/0/.


How to access harddrive-partitions:

- To handle files in Common Partitions(marked with + before name in ftp-client) 
or System partition (marked with __ before name in ftp-client) on your hd you first
need to mount them to /pfs/0/. 

+MOUNT Example (with Ctrl+R in FlashFXP): 

"SITE MNT /pfs/0/ hdd:+MYFS"

this row mounts the common partition on hd named "MYFS" to /pfs/0/ . After this just go to
/pfs/0/ and handle your files in that partition.


+UnMount Example: 

"SITE UMNT /pfs/0/"

This command unmounts the previosly mounted partition.


Common Partition are created by tools like DMS HDDFormat-tool.


Note: HDAdvance-partitions(games) can NOT be mounted and accessed at this time, 
use hdl_dump for this.
